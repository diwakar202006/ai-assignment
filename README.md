This repository contains implementations of classic Artificial Intelligence problems using different search and problem-solving techniques, developed as part of an AI laboratory assignment.

Each problem is solved using an appropriate algorithm and programming language, with clear simulations and outputs.

📌 Problems Implemented
1️⃣ Water Jug Problem

Algorithm: State-Space Search (Breadth First Search)
Language: Python

Two jugs with capacities 4 liters and 3 liters

Goal: Measure 2 liters in Jug A

Explores state space using BFS

Displays step-by-step solution path
